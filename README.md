# Lipped Channel CFS Shape Optimization Using APSO (Matlab Code)

This code aims to present a practical method for optimizing cold-formed steel (CFS) lipped channel beam-columns using an Accelerated Particle Swarm Optimization method (APSO),implemented in Matlab 2017. To eliminate impracticable cross-section shapes from the optimization results, several manufacturing and construction constraints are applied into the optimization process. The profiles were optimized with respect to their nominal strength, combing the Finite Strip Method (FSM), which provides the critical buckling loads, and the Direct Strength Method (DSM).
